    <h1>Count On Me - Bruno Mars</h1>
    <p>
        If <span class="highlight">you</span> ever find yourself stuck in the middle of <span class="highlight">the</span> sea,<br>
        I'll sail <span class="highlight">the</span> world to find you.<br><br>

        If <span class="highlight">they</span> ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see,<br>
        I'll be <span class="highlight">the</span> light to guide you.<br><br>

        We find out what <span class="highlight">we</span> <span class="highlight">are</span> made of,<br>
        When we <span class="highlight">are</span> called to help our friends in need.<br><br>

        You can count on <span class="highlight">me</span> like <span class="highlight">one, two, three</span>, I'll be there,<br>
        And I know when <span class="highlight">I</span> need it,<br>
        I can count on you like <span class="highlight">four, three, two</span>, and you'll be there,<br>
        'Cause that's what friends <span class="highlight">are</span> supposed to do, oh, yeah.<br><br>

        Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah<br><br>

        If you're tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep,<br>
        I'll sing <span class="highlight">a</span> song beside you.<br>
        And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me,<br>
        Every day I will remind <span class="highlight">you</span>, oh.<br><br>

        We find out what we're made of,<br>
        When we are called to help our friends in need.<br><br>

        You can count on <span class="highlight">me</span> like <span class="highlight">one, two, three</span>, I'll be there,<br>
        And I know when <span class="highlight">I</span> need it,<br>
        I can count on you like <span class="highlight">four, three, two</span>, and you'll be there,<br>
        'Cause that's what friends <span class="highlight">are</span> supposed to do, oh, yeah.<br><br>

        Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah<br><br>

        You'll always have <span class="highlight">my</span> shoulder when you cry.<br>
        I'll never let go, never say <span class="highlight">goodbye</span>.<br><br>

        You know you can count on <span class="highlight">me</span> like <span class="highlight">one, two, three</span>, I'll be there,<br>
        And I know when <span class="highlight">I</span> need it,<br>
        I can count on you like <span class="highlight">four, three, two</span>, and you'll be there,<br>
        'Cause that's what friends <span class="highlight">are</span> supposed to do, oh, yeah.<br><br>

        Ooh, ooh<br>
        You can count on me 'cause I can count on you.
